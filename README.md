Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+)

PostgreSQL

SendGrid API Key (for emails)

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GradNet.git
cd GradNet
2. Database Setup
Create a PostgreSQL database named gradnet (or your preferred name).

Execute the SQL scripts (typically found in schema.sql or schema_v1.sql - not included in file list but referenced in gitignore) to create the necessary tables:

users, pre_verified_students, otp_verifications

events, event_files, bookmarks

job_posts, alumni_master_data

forum_categories, forum_topics, forum_posts

conversations, conversation_participants, messages

3. Backend Configuration
Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:

Bash

cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend/ directory:

Code snippet

PORT=3000
# Database Config
DB_USER=your_postgres_user
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=gradnet_db
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_PORT=5432

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

# Email (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDER_EMAIL=your_verified_sender_email

# Frontend URL (CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
4. Frontend Configuration

Bash

cd ../frontend
npm install
Create a .env file in the frontend/ directory:

Code snippet
